Quick note:
As the nanoHTTP maven build process nowadays fails to supply the jar
file, the jar file can also downloaded here:

https://oss.sonatype.org/content/repositories/releases/org/nanohttpd/nanohttpd/2.2.0/


jmDNS:
download whole zip-Archive from https://github.com/jmdns/jmdns and create jar with

  ant jar
